# Nokia Wikipedia Search Automation

## Description
This project demonstrates an automated test using Robot Framework and SeleniumLibrary to perform a series of actions in the Firefox browser.

It opens a Nokia wikipedia page by searching the term in google. The code also takes a screenshot of the website and verifies the founding year of the company.

## Environment Setup

To run the test, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Python:** 3.11
- **Robot Framework:** 6.0.1
- **SeleniumLibrary:** 6.1.0
- **Firefox Browser:** Latest stable version
- **Geckodriver:** Compatible with the installed Firefox version

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.11**: Ensure Python 3.11 is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install python@3.11

3. **Robot Framework**: Install Robot Framework using pip or pip3 (Linux/macOS):
   ```bash
   pip install robotframework==6.0.1
   pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary==6.1.0

4. **Firefox Browser**: Download and install the latest version of Firefox from [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new).

5. **Geckodriver**: Download the compatible Geckodriver for your Firefox version from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases), and ensure it's available in your system's PATH.
